# Logo Extraction Application

This application is designed to extract logos from images. It consists of a frontend built using Next.js and a backend built using FastAPI.

**Frontend:**

The frontend is responsible for providing a user interface to upload images and display the extracted logos. It is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and performance-optimized websites and applications. The frontend handles image uploads, sends requests to the backend for logo extraction, and displays the extracted logos to the user.

**Backend:**

The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is responsible for processing image uploads, extracting logos from the images using various AI models, and returning the extracted logos to the frontend. The backend also handles authentication, database operations, and other server-side logic.

**App Description:**

The Logo Extraction Application is designed to simplify the process of extracting logos from images. Users can upload images to the application, and the backend will use AI models to identify and extract the logo from the image. The extracted logo is then displayed to the user, allowing them to easily access and use the logo as needed. This application is particularly useful for businesses, designers, and individuals who need to extract logos from images for various purposes, such as branding, marketing, or design projects.
